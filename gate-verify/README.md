## Verification Stage
Verification Gate enables customers to release software with lower risk into production. It provides AI-powered risk assessment and release verification based on the data coming from monitoring providers. Monitoring data for new software updates is compared with the baseline to determine if the new software release is comparable to the software already running in production. This allows users to determine whether the new software update is ready to be promoted to the production environment. Threhsolds can be set in the Gate configuration to promote the software release.
